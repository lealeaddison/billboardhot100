Overview:
This project will analyze Billboard Hot 100 chart data from 1958–2017 to explore patterns in musical success — specifically comparing artists who had only one major hit (“one-hit wonders”) to those with multiple recurring hits (“superstars”). Using data science techniques, I’ll examine differences in chart performance, longevity, and how these patterns evolved over time.

Goals:
Identify and classify artists as one-hit wonders or superstars based on the number of unique songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100.
Compare their average chart rankings and time spent on the charts.
Visualize how the prevalence of one-hit wonders and superstars has changed across decades.

Data Source:
Billboard Hot 100 dataset (1958–2017) from data.world/kcmillersean.

Tools & Methods:
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Aggregation and grouping to identify artist patterns.
Time-based visualizations to track trends by decade.

Expected Outcome:
The analysis will highlight trends in the music industry, such as whether the rate of one-hit wonders has increased over time, and provide insight into what distinguishes enduring artists from fleeting successes.
